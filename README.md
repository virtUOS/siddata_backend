# SIDDATA Backend Server

The joint project for Individualization of Studies through Digital, Data-Driven Assistants (SIDDATA, www.siddata.de)
aims to encourage students to define their own study goals and to follow them consistently. The data-driven environment
will be able to give hints, reminders and recommendations appropriate to the situation, as well as regarding local and
remote courses and Open Educational Resources (OER). This repository contains the code for the backend server which
collects, refines and analyses data to generate personalized recommendation.
